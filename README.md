# Slides and code for the 1st Deep Learning Club Seminar
Tuesday, 11th Oct. 2016 - 1pm
Amphitheatre Jaques Monod.

## Introduction to Deep Learning
Christophe Zimmer, Imaging and Modeling Unit

* [download slides](./DeepLearningIntro-DLClub-Oct-11-2016-ChZ.pdf)
* [code, ipython notebook](https://github.com/imodpasteur/mnist-deep-learning-tutorial/blob/master/KerasMNIST.ipynb)
* [code, kaggle kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/weiouyang/d/weiouyang/test-dataset/keras-mnist)

Note: If you download the ipython notebook code, you will need to install keras on your own comupter, and setup everything yourself.

For a quick test, you can use sign up on kaggle and fork the kaggle kernel, and use it without any local installation.

## Analyzing CRISPR Screen Data using Neural Networks
David Bikard, Synthetic Biology Group

* not available

## Whole Brain Simulations and the Discrepancy/Similarity between Artificial and Natural Neural Networks
Guillaume Dumas,
Human Genetics and Cognitive Function Unit

* [see slides](http://www.slideshare.net/gdumas/whole-brain-simulations-and-the-discrepancysimilarity-between-artificial-natural-neural-networks)
